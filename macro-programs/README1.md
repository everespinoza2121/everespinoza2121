# Macro Programs

This folder contains G-code macros built for family parts.  
Each macro uses variables and conditional logic to reduce the need for multiple programs.

## Why it matters
- Less time editing G-code
- Fewer mistakes during setup
- Easier training for new machinists

Each file includes documentation and example use cases.
