# Prompt Tools for G-code Automation

This folder contains carefully designed **prompt templates** used to generate, revise, or optimize G-code with the help of AI tools like ChatGPT.

These prompts are written in natural language and tailored to CNC machinists and programmers. They serve as blueprints for generating accurate, shop-ready code with minimal manual editing.

## Why Prompt Tools?

Traditional G-code editing is time-consuming and error-prone.  
By developing reusable prompts, I’m enabling machinists and programmers to:

- Generate code on demand using job-specific specs
- Modify existing programs quickly with AI assistance
- Standardize common machining operations
- Reduce dependency on CAM software for simple jobs

## What You’ll Find Here

Each prompt file is written in Markdown (`.md`) and includes:

- **Prompt Title**
- **Use Case or Scenario**
- **The actual prompt (copy/paste ready)**
- **Expected output example**
- **Notes or tips** for improving the prompt or result
