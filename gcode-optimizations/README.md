# G-code Optimizations

This folder showcases real-world examples of optimized G-code — with a focus on speed, clarity, and efficiency.

Each file includes:
- **Original code** as it was manually written or output from a CAM system
- **Optimized code** with changes made using AI prompt engineering or macro improvements
- **Comments explaining** why changes were made and the benefits (shorter cycles, cleaner toolpaths, reduced wear, etc.)

## Why G-code Optimization Matters

Even small inefficiencies in a CNC program can add up to lost time, increased tool wear, and higher production costs.  
By combining 20+ years of CNC experience with prompt engineering tools, I’m able to:

- Refactor messy or bloated code
- Simplify tool movements
- Combine cycles and reduce unnecessary operations
- Make G-code easier to read, teach, and maintain

## Example Types You’ll Find Here

- **Thread cycles (G76) cleaned up**
- **G71 roughing cycles made more efficient**
- **Redundant tool changes removed**
- **Safe start blocks simplified**
- **Variables used for repeatable logic**

## Coming Soon

More before/after code comparisons and prompt-powered G-code revisions.

> The future of programming isn’t just code — it’s smart, efficient, and powered by intelligent prompts.
