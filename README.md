# Ever Espinoza – CNC Programmer & Prompt Engineer for G-code Innovation

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a CNC Machinist and Programmer with over **20 years of hands-on experience** in precision manufacturing, turning centers, and G-code development. Today, I’m pioneering a new frontier: using **prompt engineering** and AI to revolutionize how G-code is written, optimized, and deployed on the shop floor.

## My Mission

To build smarter, faster, and more reliable CNC solutions by merging traditional programming with the power of artificial intelligence and prompt-based automation.

## What Makes Me Different

As a machinist fluent in both the **language of the shop** and the **language of machines**, I’m uniquely positioned to develop AI prompts and automation tools that actually make sense to real-world programmers. I don’t just write code — I cut metal, fix problems, and streamline workflows using a deep understanding of:

- G-code programming (Fanuc, Haas, Macro B)
- CNC lathe and mill operation
- Setup optimization & tooling efficiency
- AI prompt workflows for rapid code generation and revision

## What I'm Building

### `macro-programs/`
Parametric G-code templates and macro programs that allow a single file to handle an entire **family of parts** using variables and conditional logic.

### `prompt-tools/`
AI prompt templates that generate or modify G-code — making CAM-like results accessible without expensive software or hours of manual typing.

### `gcode-optimizations/`
Before-and-after examples of optimized G-code using prompt engineering, targeting better cycle times, cleaner toolpaths, and more maintainable code.

## Real-World Skills I Bring

- Over 20 years of CNC experience in both high-volume and prototype settings
- Proficiency in multi-axis turning, canned cycles, and custom macros
- Fluent with machine setups, offsets, and troubleshooting
- Currently integrating **AI prompt systems** into the G-code development workflow to reduce manual programming time and increase part consistency

## Tools I Use

- CNC Machines: Haas, Fanuc  
- Software: GibbsCAM, NC Viewer, OpenAI, GitHub  
- Languages: G-code, Macro B, Prompt Engineering (natural language)

## Why Prompt Engineering for CNC?

Because the next generation of CNC programmers won’t be just coders — they’ll be **problem-solvers who command AI tools** to write better, faster, safer code. Prompt engineering is the bridge between **tribal knowledge and digital transformation**.

## Follow the Journey

I’m sharing real projects, live code, and toolkits designed to help machinists, engineers, and shops **automate intelligently without losing control**.

> The shop of the future is already here — and it starts with a prompt.
