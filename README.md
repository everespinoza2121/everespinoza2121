# Hi, I'm Ever — G-code Prompt Engineer & CNC Automation Specialist

Welcome to my GitHub!

I’m a CNC machinist and a new breed of **prompt engineer**, using AI and automation to streamline G-code programming. My mission is to make CNC workflows faster, smarter, and easier — not by replacing the machinist, but by **amplifying what’s possible with prompt-driven tools**.

## What I Do
- **G-code Automation:**  
  I build **macro programs** to handle family parts, minimizing manual edits and setup time.

- **Prompt-Powered G-code Optimization:**  
  I create **custom prompt workflows** that analyze, clean, and enhance G-code for better efficiency and safety.

- **AI Tools for Machinists:**  
  I explore how **prompt engineering** can help shops reduce human error, standardize programs, and automate CAM-related tasks.

## Current Projects
- `macro-programs/` – Smart parametric G-code templates using Fanuc-style variables.
- `prompt-tools/` – AI prompts that write or revise G-code based on user specs.
- `gcode-optimizations/` – Before & after examples of prompt-assisted code improvements.

## Tech Stack
- **Machines:** Haas, Fanuc, Siemens  
- **Languages:** G-code, Macro B, VBA, Prompt Engineering, LLMs. 
- **Tools:** NC Viewer, ChatGPT, GitHub, GibbsCAM  
- **Coming soon:** Chatbot assistants for shops

## Why This Matters
Manual G-code edits slow down shops. I believe AI-powered prompts can:
- Save time.
- Reduce mistakes.
- Keep machinists in control.

This is just the beginning.
